###To-Do:

- [x] Find Thesaurus API -> Use Mirriam Webster API to retrieve synonyms
- [x] Get rid of form elements -> clickless application
- [x] Modify current text box area so that it takes 50% of area instead of max 600, add <p></p> tag to fill on right hand side
- [x] Use JQuery to register event listener for changes in text area
- [x] Use JQuery to modify paragraph on right hand side so that it mirrors text in box
- [X] Basic request for synonyms - first word entered is synonymized
- [ ] Implement smarter synonym logic
